# Create an automatic user password generator. Users.txt login file that uses a list of users

# Automatically generate passwords for all users,
# create a linux-system with generated passwords in the users script
# so that you can log in with the name of each user with a password created for it
# (here it is supposed to work with openssl),
# and also create a user * file for each user -login-password.txt,
# in which to put the username and the generated password.
